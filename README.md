# Bogus.JsonWeb
Simple and lightweight extension package for [Bogus Faker](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus) for faking  [JSON WebTokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token)




This is a fresh project, I just uploaded the code as I recently needed to create fake JWT data for unit testing my routine. Soon I will provide this package on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org)
